# Bikesharing

## Project Overview
In this study, we analyze the feasibility of putting in place a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa using data from Citi Bike. Based on the market's age, gender, and time categories in New York City in August 2019. In accordance with these categories, Tableau Public visualizations are created to reflect the analyst's perspective, as well as nay future investors. All charts are uploaded to Tableau Server so they can be shared.

- In August, 146,752 of the 2,344,224 rides lasted 5 minutes or less. The trip duration was mostly under an hour and the peak was 5 minutes.
- As seen by the checkout times broken down by gender, the unknown category peak at 10 minutes pers ride all other categories peak at 5 minutes per ride.
- In August, peak times can be divided into morning and afternoon times. THe morning peak hours are between 8-9am, and the afternoon peak hours are between 4-7pm.
- When we divide the heatmap by day and time, the peak hours in the weekday are the same, but during the weekend, we see more steady times between 9am and 7pm.
- There is a consistent trend among the results across the board whether it be male, female, or the unknown, according to the heatmap.
- The majority of subscribers are male compared to female and unknown, and those who are unknown tend to be one-time customers rather than subscribers.
- A summary of the analysis between the three categories in the last dashboard of the story. As can be seen, there are much more males than any other gender. Most of our customers are born after the 1970's and into the 2000's: however, there are stil spikes of older age customers who have longer trips than the average. It is Sunday that has the most rides, with 408,622.

## Summary
In terms of its bike sharing program, New York City's data during August 2019 gives a good indication of what Des Moines may be capable of. In New York, most regular subscribers are male and travel during the week. As a result, I suspect that this is primarily used by workers to get around rather than by tourists. This is the biggest reliable market that Des Moines can reach to grow the program since it is a fast growing city for office workers. Additionally, residents from the city could travel to the city's botanical gardens, farmer's market, and sculpture parks to see the city's vast cultural amenities. Despite this data being a good start to what Des Moines bike sharing program might be like, there are a few more details that may prove useful to investors. Statistical analysis can be performed by comparing the average lifespan of the bike and mapping popular routes based on the origin and destination rides.
